# java-cli-bazel-hibernate-ssl-postgres-case-count

## Description
Creates a small database table
called `dog` and populates with
hql. Creates 2 lookup tables `breedLookup`
and `colorLookup` and 4N `dog`.

Joins `breedLookup` and `colorLookup`
to form a new table `dogextended`. These
case-counts are deministrated 3 ways, `ResultTransformer`,
looking up ids on `breedLookup` and `colorLookup`,
and non-ResultTransformer method.

Add an immutable entity `breedcount` as a case-count uses a subquery join.

Updated an immutable entity `breedcount` as a view using a subselect with 
case and join.

Uses self-sign ssl.
